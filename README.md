## PROJECT PROPOSAL:

Creat an app that will link businesses with extra food (grocery stores, restaurantes, etc.) & Homeless shelters via volunteers who will deliver the food from A to B.

Volunteers, Donors & Recipients will each have logins and profiles, which will track their history with the app.

Work Flow:
Donor will log in and post what food they have, as well as quantity. The post will go up on the board and be visible via a pin in google maps.

Volunteers will pick a pin convenient for them, and the post will be moved to "spoken for" so no one else tries to pick it up. The volunteer will immmediately be given directions via google maps from current location to the donor, and then from the donor to the recipient. The volunteer will go to business and the business (Donor) will check in the app that the food was picked up by the volunteer.

The volunteer will deliver the food and the recipient will log in and check in the app that the food was delivered.

The volunteer will receive points based on how much food was delivered and/or other things.
